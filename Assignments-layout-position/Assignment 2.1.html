						<h3>Badminton</h3><br>
						<p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock 
						   across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common 
						   forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" 
						   (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor 
						   activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular 
						   indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet 
						   and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.

						   Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. 
						   Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been 
						   called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.
						   The full width of the court is 6.1 metres (20 feet), and in singles this width 
						   is reduced to 5.18 metres (17.0 feet). The full length of the court is 13.4 
						   metres (44 feet). The service courts are marked by a centre line dividing the 
						   width of the court, by a short service line at a distance of 1.98 metres 
						   (6 feet 6 inches) from the net, and by the outer side and back boundaries. 
						   In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which 
						   is 0.76 metres (2 feet 6 inches) from the back boundary.</p>
